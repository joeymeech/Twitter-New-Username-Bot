#Twitter Username bot


python

This is a twitter bot that will login to your account
and try to change the username, if the username is taken it 
will keep trying until twitter says that the username is 
available. Once it is available it will set it as your new username.

This bot comes in two different formats, twitterbot.py is just
the normal bot that will open a window and you can see everything 
happen. The other headlesstwitterbot.py is the same thing but
the browser won't pop up, this is better for just leaving it
on in the background.

Checklist:

-Python 3 installed

-Pip or some other way of installing

and put it in the same path as your twitter bot file

-Correct information entered into the .py file
