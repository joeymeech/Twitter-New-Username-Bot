#Twitter New Username bot


python

This is a twitter bot that will login to your account
and try to change the username, if the username is taken it 
will keep trying until twitter says that the username is 
available. Once it is available it will set it as your new username.

This bot comes in two different formats, twitterbot.py is just
the normal bot that will open a window and you can see everything 
happen. The other headlesstwitterbot.py is the same thing but
the browser won't pop up, this is better for just leaving it
on in the background.

Requirments:

You need python 3 installed onto your device
You need pip or some other way of installing
modules
You only need to install the selenium module which is done by
typing "pip install selenium" in your terminal if you are using
pip

Next you will need to download the chrome webdriver, that
is done by visiting
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.43/
and downloading the right file for your os.

Lastly you need to enter your correct information into the .py file.
I labeled what you have to change in the file so just open it up 
with some kind of text editor and fill out your information and save
it then you are ready to run it.
