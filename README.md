#Twitter New Username bot
python

This is a headless twitter bot that will login to your account
and try to change the username, if that username is taken it 
will keep trying until twitter says that the username is 
available. Once it is available it will set it to your username.

This is pretty easy to get working and is deciently effective
for trying to get a username you want

I personaly just used this running in the background 24/7 on my
desktop PC and it has worked multiple times in the past.

Requirments:

You need python 3 installed onto your device
You need pip or some other way of installing
modules
You only need to install the selenium module which is done by
typing "pip install selenium" in your terminal

Next you will need to download the chrome webdriver and that
is done by visiting
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.43/
and downloading the right file for your os.

Lastly you need to enter your correct information into the .py file.
I labeled what you have to change in the file so just open it up 
with some kind of text editor and fill out your information and save
it then you are ready to run it.
